Importing this template requires Custom System Builder to be installed on Foundry.

# Installation

1. Install "Custom System Builder" and create a game using it as the System.
2. Copy and paste the whole folder for this project (CBR-PNK-CSB-Template) into whatever folder you have designated for Foundry's User Data.
3. Login to the game as the Gamemaster.
4. Go to the "Game Settings" tab and click the "Import templates JSON" button.  Select the file "cbr-pnk-CSB.json" from the folder you pasted into your User Data.  The game will reload to finish installing the template.
5. Add the CSS file (See CSS chapter below for more details).
6. Add in the fonts (See Fonts chapter below for more details).

# CSS

1. Navigate to the "Game Settings" tab and click the "Configure Settings" button.
2. Under the "Custom System Builder" section, look for the option "CSS Style file". Here you will add the path to the CSS file ("cbr-pnk-styles.CSS").
NOTE: This will not show up in Foundry's list of files, even if it's there, nor can it be uploaded through Foundry. It must be added by typing in "CBR-PNK-CSB-Template/cbr-pnk-styles.css" (or whatever your path for it may be, depending on how you organize your User Data folder).

# Fonts

1. While in your Custom System Builder game, go to "Game Settings".
2. Click the "Configure Settings" button.
3. Click the "Configure Additional Fonts" button.
4. Fill in the following fonts one-by-one being sure to hit the "+ Add Font" button after each. They will appear in the list at the top of the Configure Additional Fonts window.  Do not deviate from the following structure as it will break the CSS styling. 

NOTE: All font files can be found in the CBR-PNK-CSB-Template/Fonts folder.

	Font 1: Cygnito Mono
		Font Family: Cygnito Mono

# Recommended Steps

1. In the character sheet titled "Runner" go into the "Configure Sheet Display" settings and update the default width/height to 750 and the profile picture width/height 250.
2. See my other repository for CBR+PNK Image Assets that includes Landing Page and Character Token images and image templates for putting extra polish on the look and feel of the system. (COMING SOON!)
3. I use the following Modules for my game - Better Dice Formulas, Custom Nameplates, Dice So Nice, Dice Tray, Global Progress Clocks, Monk's Active Tile Triggers, PNP - Pointer and Pings! (BETA), and Pause Customizer.
