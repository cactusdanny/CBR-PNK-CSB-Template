# CBR+PNK for FoundryVTT's Custom System Builder

[CBR+PNK](https://emanoelmelo.itch.io/cbrpnk-core) was created by Emanoel Melo

Template created by Cactusdan for [Custom System Builder](https://gitlab.com/custom-system-builder/custom-system-builder)

*Custom System Builder is required for this template to be installed on Foundry.*

Example:

*(The character token in the above example was created using my CBR+PNK token template (COMING SOON). Tokens will come in however you create them.)*

# Installation

1. Install "Custom System Builder" and create a game using it as the System.
2. Copy and paste the whole folder for this project (CBR-PNK-CSB-Template) into whatever folder you have designated for Foundry's User Data.
3. Login to the game as the Gamemaster.
4. Go to the "Game Settings" tab and click the "Import templates JSON" button.  Select the file "cbr-pnk-CSB.json" from the folder you pasted into your User Data.  The game will reload to finish installing the template.
5. Add the CSS file (See CSS section below for more details).
6. Add in the icon font (See Font section below for more details).

# CSS

1. Navigate to the "Game Settings" tab and click the "Configure Settings" button.
2. Under the "Custom System Builder" section, look for the option "CSS Style file". Here you will add the path to the CSS file ("cbr-pnk-styles.CSS").

NOTE: The CSS file will not show up in Foundry's list of files, even if it's there, nor can it be uploaded through Foundry. It must be added by typing in "CBR-PNK-CSB-Template/cbr-pnk-styles.css" (or whatever your path for it may be, depending on how you organize your User Data folder).

# Font

1. While in your Custom System Builder game, go to "Game Settings".
2. Click the "Configure Settings" button.
3. Click the "Configure Additional Fonts" button.
4. Fill in the following font info, being sure to hit the "+ Add Font" once done to add it to the game. Do not deviate from the following as it will break the CSS styling. 

NOTE: Font file can be found in the "CBR-PNK-CSB-Template/Fonts" folder.

	Font 3: CBR+PNK Icons
		Font Family: cbrpnkicons
		Font Weight: Regular 400
		Font Style: Normal
		Font File: cbrpnk_icons.ttf

# Recommended Steps

1. In the character sheet titled "Runner" go into the "Configure Sheet Display" settings and update the default width/height to 900 and the profile picture width/height to 250.
2. In "Configure Settings" increase Font Size to 7 or 8 (the default font comes in a bit small)
3. I use the following Modules for my game - Better Dice Formulas, Custom Nameplates, Dice So Nice, Dice Tray, Global Progress Clocks, Monk's Active Tile Triggers, PNP - Pointer and Pings! (BETA), and Pause Customizer.
4. See my other repository for CBR+PNK Image Assets that includes Landing Page and Character Token images and image templates for putting extra polish on the look and feel of the system. (COMING SOON!)
